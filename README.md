# Sparky AI (Image Alt Tags)

This is a very simple recipe that setups up AI generated alt tags using the Sparky AI base module. 

Assuming your providers are set up correctly, applying this recipe should be installed and working with the following settings:

* Alt text is auto-generated on upload
* Bulk update module is enabled (to generate all)

## Configuration requirements

* Permissions: manually update permissions for the roles who are allowed to have AI generated alt text (typically all content editors and managers.)
