# Sparky AI (Image Alt Text)

This is a very simple recipe that setups up AI generated alt tags using the [Sparky AI](https://github.com/electriccitizen/sparky_ai) base module. 

Assuming your providers are set up correctly, applying this recipe should be installed and working with the following settings:

## What it does

* Installs the ai_image_alt_text modules
* Configures auto-generation on upload
* Bulk update module is enabled (to generate missing alt text)

## Configuration requirements

* Permissions: manually update permissions for the roles who are allowed to have AI generated alt text (typically all content editors and managers.)
